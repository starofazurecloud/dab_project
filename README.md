# dab_project
Welcome to the repository for the Udemy course `CI/CD with Databricks Asset Bundles`. This repository serves as a supplementary resource, specifically providing project files used in the course..

## Wiki
This repository contains a [wiki](https://github.com/pathfinder-analytics-uk/dab_project/wiki) with project code and yaml configuration snippets for specific lectures.

The [wiki](https://github.com/pathfinder-analytics-uk/dab_project/wiki) is organised into sections and pages that align with the structure of the course. Each page corresponds to a particular lecture, making it easy to follow along and reference the material as you progress through the course.

`dab_project` is the name given to the project and was generated by using the default-python template.

## Getting started

Before you run or deploy this project, you'll have to follow along with the Udemy course to set up your environment (Databricks Workspaces, Service Principals, GitHub Repository etc.).

You will also need to update the `databricks.yml` configuration file with your Workspace URLs and Service Principal details.

You'll also want to set up local Python environments for Databricks Connect and local PySpark development. Follow the instructions for your platform below.

### Virtual Environment Setup

#### macOS / Linux

1. **Create and activate the Databricks Connect environment (using Python 3.11)**
   ```bash
   # at the project root
   python3.11 -m venv .venv_dbc
   source .venv_dbc/bin/activate
   ```
2. **Install Databricks Connect dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dbc.txt
   ```
3. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   pip list
   deactivate
   ```

4. **Create and activate the local PySpark environment**
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv .venv_pyspark
   source .venv_pyspark/bin/activate
   ```
5. **Install PySpark dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-pyspark.txt
   ```
6. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   pip list
   deactivate
   ```

#### Windows

1. **Create and activate the Databricks Connect environment (using Python 3.11)**
   ```powershell
   # at the project root
   py -3.11 -m venv .venv_dbc
   .\.venv_dbc\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. **Install Databricks Connect dependencies**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements-dbc.txt
   ```
3. **Verify installation**
   ```powershell
   pip list
   deactivate
   ```

4. **Create and activate the local PySpark environment**
   ```powershell
   python -m venv .venv_pyspark
   .\.venv_pyspark\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
5. **Install PySpark dependencies**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements-pyspark.txt
   ```
6. **Verify installation**
   ```powershell
   pip list
   deactivate
   ```

### Databricks CLI, Set-Up and Bundle Commands

1. Install the Databricks CLI
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/setup-cli/main/install.sh | sh
   ```
   or alternatively on a MacOS if you need admin override
   ```bash
   sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/setup-cli/main/install.sh | sudo sh
   ```

2. Authenticate to your Databricks workspace, if you have not done so already:
    ```bash
    databricks configure
    ```

3. To deploy a development copy of this project, type:
    ```bash
    databricks bundle deploy --target dev
    ```
    (Note that "dev" is the default target, so the `--target` parameter
    is optional here.)

    This deploys everything that's defined for this project.
    For example, the default template would deploy a job called
    `[dev yourname] dab_project_job` to your workspace.
    You can find that job by opening your workspace and clicking on **Workflows**.

4. Similarly, to deploy a production copy, type:
   ```bash
   databricks bundle deploy --target prod
   ```

   Note that the default job from the template has a schedule that runs every day
   (defined in resources/dab_project.job.yml). The schedule
   is paused when deploying in development mode (see
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/deployment-modes.html).

5. To run a job or pipeline, use the "run" command:
   ```bash
   databricks bundle run
   ```

6. Optionally, install developer tools such as the Databricks extension for Visual Studio Code from
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/vscode-ext.html.

7. For documentation on the Databricks asset bundles format used
   for this project, and for CI/CD configuration, see
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/index.html.
